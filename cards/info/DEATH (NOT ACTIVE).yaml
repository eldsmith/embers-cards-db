      A player who dies is removed from the board. He can no longer play until
      he has been resurrected.<br><be>Resurrection:</be> Though you can no
      longer play on the board you may still play in <be>Archipelago</be>, as
      Archipelago represents the very edge of the dream world and death -- you
      are stuck there until you find a <bee>Resurrection Stone</bee>.<br><br>


      The second way to get a <bee>Resurrection Stone</bee> is by entering a
      special dungeon called <beg>Waluigi's Tomb</beg>. Once someone dies for
      the first time, reveal <beg>3 dungeons</beg>. Complete any one of these
      dungeons to gain a <bee>Resurrection Stone</bee>. Once a dungeon is
      completed replace it with a fresh dungeon.<br><br>


      The final way to escape death is that of sacrifice. You must take <be>10
      corruption</be> in an area decided by a roll of the die.
